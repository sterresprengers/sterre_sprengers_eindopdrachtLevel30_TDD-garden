1. Costs per crop = cost per plant x amount of plants per crop

    The costs of sowing a plant are fixed per plant.
    Example: Sowing 1 maize plant costs 1 euro.
    If you have a crop of 230 maize plants, the costs for that crop are therefore 230 euros.


2. Revenue = sale price x kilo's fruit

    Each plant has a "sale price". That is how many euros you earn with one kilo of fruit or vegetables from that plant.

    If apples have a sale price of 2 euros and we sell 5 kilos of apples, then the revenue is 10 euros.

3. Yield = standard in kilo's (if no enviromental factor are at play)

4. "profits" is profit, so that is revenue - costs.
